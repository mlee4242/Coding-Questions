1.) During my first internship at Jana (summer of freshman to sophomore year), one feature I worked on was integrating YouTube videos into the mCent platform. Jana's clients
wanted their customers to be able to watch a YouTube video of their choosing, and once the video finishes, the page generates a link that the customers can click on to receive rewards. At the time,
it was an experimental feature to see how it would function, and it was the first time in the codebase that we would be trying out to integrate the YouTube API. I was the only one working on it,
and I managed to be able to get the feature working completely after a couple of days of reading through the YouTube docs and fiddling with the API code. I got to informally do a demo for my manager 
and the head of marketing operations as well, and being able to showcase a feature to the higher-ups that I worked on completely by myself felt amazing. Part of why I was so proud too was because
at the time I was really inexperienced since I only had taken intro-level sequence CS courses so far in school, and being able to self-learn what I needed to know to produce a feature was kind of a 
proof to myself that I could really see myself working in this kind of field in the future. My work definitely wasn't perfect though, the page UI was kind of lackluster, and
Jana discontinued the feature itself sometime between my first and my second internship since they shifted more towards the mobile market. But personally, the experience of being able to code something 
new and exciting that other people could potentially use was an incredible feeling, UI issues aside.

2.) I read an article recently about how a young teenager crashed a replica of a government website using SQL injections (https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/21/i-just-hacked-a-state-election-17-not-a-good-hacker-219374),
and I thought it was a good read because it goes to show how undervalued good security is and also how scary it is that people can easily take advantage of unsanitized input fields when information to be able to do so is widely
available on the internet. I think others should also read it because it serves as a reminder that our users are also our worst enemies when it comes to unsanitary input, and that we always have to
think about whenever the user has input, how we can sanitize all forms of input so the product does not crash or work in unexpected and unintended ways.

3.) I really like the dashboard feature of the product because in the perspective of the user, it's an incredibly helpful feature to able to not only visualize data, but to quickly recognize
any issues that come up from data that they're trying to monitor. It makes trying to dissect the data easy on the eyes also and makes for an efficient usage of their time when trying
to resolve issues.

4.) See flatten_array.py.

test_flatten_array.py runs the test cases for flatten_array.py.

5.) See timeseries.py; running "python timeseries.py" will print out the statistics of the data points within timeseries.csv.

test_timeseries.py runs the test cases for timeseries.py. Included are extra .csv files for testing (empty_test.csv and test_timeseries.csv) that are used in test_timeseries.py.

To run the unit tests in 4.) and 5.), run "python <name of unittest file>".
